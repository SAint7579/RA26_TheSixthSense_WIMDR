# SmartWasteWebsite
Manager Website for Smart Waste Locator

This website would be helpful for all the concerned authorities to view the presence of garbage through out the city, which is being detected automatically by our Smart Waste Locator device.

The concerned authorities may include government officials, NGO's, CSR funding initiatives, etc. So the portal would help them to assign all the tasks to the garbage picker staff based of pin point location. Also there is a verification mechanism included in the garbage pickers app.
